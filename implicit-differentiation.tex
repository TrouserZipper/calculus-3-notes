\section{Implicit Differentiation}

Suppose we have an equation \(F(x,y) = 0\) which implicitly defines y as a function of \(x\). That is, \(y=f(x)\) where \(F(x,f(x)) = 0\) , for all \(x\)  in the domain of \(f\).  

If \(F\) is differentiable, we may use the Chain Rule (Case 1) on both sides of the equation \(F(x,y) = 0\):
\[
	\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} \frac{dx}{dx} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial y} \frac{dy}{dx} =0
\]
\(\frac{dx}{dx} = 1\) 
\[
	\Rightarrow \frac{dy}{dx}= \frac{-\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} }{\frac{\partial F}{\partial Y} } = -\frac{F_x}{F_y}	
\]

Now, suppose \(z\) is implicitly defined as a function of \(z=f(x,y)\) by an equation \(F(x,y,z) = 0\). That is, \(F(x,y,f(x,y) = 0\) for all \((x,y)\) in the domain of \(f\). Then, if \(F\) and \(f\) are differentiable:
\[
	F(x,y,z) = 0
\]

\underline{Partial Derivative with respect to \(x\) }:
\[
	\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} \frac{dx}{dx} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial y} \frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{\partial F}{\partial z} \frac{dz}{dx} = 0
\]

\subsubsection{Implicit Differentiation Example 1}
Find \(y'\) if \(x^3+y^3=xy\) 

\subsubsection{Implicit Differentiation Example 2}
Find \(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \) and \(\frac{\partial z}{\partial y} \) if \(x^4+y^4+z^4+2xyz = 1\) 

\subsection{Implicit Differentiation Exercises}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item If \(z=x^2y+3xy^4\), where \(x=\sin(2t)\) and \(y=\cos(t)\), find \(\frac{dz}{dt}\) when \(t=0\)   
	\item If \(u=x^4y+y^2z^3, \) where \(x=rse^t,\ y=rs^2e^{-t},\) and \(z=r^2\sin(t)\), find \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial s}\) when \(r=2\),\(s=1\), and \(t=0\)   
	\item Find \(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} \) and \(\frac{\partial z}{\partial y} \) if \(x^3+y^3+z^3+6xyz = 1\) 
	\item Revisit the Ideal Gas Law: \(PV = 8.31T\). Find the rate at which the pressure is changing when the temperature is \(300K\) and increasing by \(0.1K/s\) and teh volume is \(100L\) and increasing by \(0.2L/s\).
